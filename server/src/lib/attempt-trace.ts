// Per-request attempt trace: the durable record of the failover ladder one
// proxied request walked (groq 429 → google timeout → cerebras ok). The
// fallback loop collects one AttemptTraceRecord per dispatched attempt —
// including the SUCCESSFUL final one — and request-log.ts persists the batch
// into `request_attempts`, keyed to the terminal `requests` row.
//
// The trace travels on AsyncLocalStorage (same pattern as client-context.ts)
// so logRequest() can report back the id of each `requests` row it writes
// without threading a parameter through every surface's dispatch closure.
// The LAST id noted during a loop run is the terminal row — the success row,
// a committed mid-stream error row, or the final per-attempt failure row —
// and that is the row the batch is keyed to. Calls to logRequest outside a
// fallback-loop run (fusion sub-calls, embeddings, media) see no trace and
// are unaffected.
